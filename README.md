## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. *Data Architecture*: Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture (*Bronze*, *Silver*, and *Gold* layers).
2. *ETL Pipelines*: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. *Data Modeling*: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. *Analytics & Reporting*: Creating SQL-based reports and Tableau dashboards for actionable insights.
5. *Advanced Analytics*: Performing customer analytics using Python, including *RFM segmentation*, *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)*, *churn & retention analysis*, and *revenue prioritization* with insights, recommendations, and visuals.

## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using MySQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision making.

#### Specifications
- *Data Sources*: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- *Data Quality*: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- *Integration*: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- *Scope*: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- *Documentation*: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics and Tableau dashboards to deliver detailed insights into:
- *Customer Behavior*
- *Product Performance*
- *Sales Trends*

🛢️ *SQL Query*

SQL is used to generate clean, reliable analytical datasets from the data warehouse, while *Tableau* is used to build interactive dashboards and KPI reports that provide high-level business visibility.

📊 *Tableau Dashboard*  
- View the interactive Tableau dashboards here: [Tableau Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wisdom.mpamugo/viz/salesbaraaproject/customersummary)

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling *data-driven strategic decision-making*.

---

### Advanced Analytics (Python)

#### Objective
Extend dashboard-level insights with advanced exploratory data analysis using Python to uncover deeper customer behavior patterns and business opportunities.

#### Key Analyses
- *RFM Segmentation* (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)*
- *Churn & Retention Analysis*
- *Revenue & Customer Value Prioritization*
- *Customer Value & Engagement Action Matrix*
- *Business insights, recommendations, and visual storytelling*

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture (*Bronze*, *Silver*, and *Gold* layers):

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. *Bronze Layer*: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.
2. *Silver Layer*: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. *Gold Layer*: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
